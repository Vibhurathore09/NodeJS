The dns module enables name resolution . For example , use it to look up IP addressses of host names;

lookup() - It resolves a host name into the fist found A(IPv4) or AAAA (IPv5) record . lookup() does not necessarily have anyhting to do with the DNS protocol . The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names with addesses , and vice versa
